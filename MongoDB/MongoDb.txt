 ## What are aggregation pipelines with mongoose? **

    => An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents:

    -> Each stage performs an operation on the input documents.  For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.

    -> The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.

    -> An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.

    -> we can update documents with an aggregation pipeline if you use the stages shown in Updates with Aggregation Pipeline.

    => Aggregation pipelines in Mongoose are a way to perform advanced data processing and transformation on collections of documents in MongoDB.
    => An aggregation pipeline is a series of stages that documents pass through, each stage applying a transformation or computation to the data.
    => Mongoose provides a powerful API for building aggregation pipelines using its aggregate() method.
        -- The aggregate() method takes an array of pipeline stages as its argument and returns a Aggregate object that can be used to execute the pipeline.

    =>Example:
        db.orders.insertMany( [
    { _id: 0, name: "Pepperoni", size: "small", price: 19,
        quantity: 10, date: ISODate( "2021-03-13T08:14:30Z" ) },
    { _id: 1, name: "Pepperoni", size: "medium", price: 20,
        quantity: 20, date : ISODate( "2021-03-13T09:13:24Z" ) },
    { _id: 2, name: "Pepperoni", size: "large", price: 21,
        quantity: 30, date : ISODate( "2021-03-17T09:22:12Z" ) },
        ]);

        -> Calculate the total order quantity:->

        db.orders.aggregate( [
        // Stage 1: Filter pizza order documents by pizza size
        {
        $match: { size: "medium" }
        },
        // Stage 2: Group remaining documents by pizza name and calculate total quantity
        {
        $group: { _id: "$name", totalQuantity: { $sum: "$quantity" } }
        }
        ] )

        => The result of the aggregation pipeline will be an array of objects that contains the computed filterd by size and total quantity.
        => Mongoose's aggregation pipelines provide a powerful way to perform complex data processing and transformation in MongoDB. The API is flexible and expressive, allowing you to compose pipelines with multiple stages and operators to compute exactly the data you need.
