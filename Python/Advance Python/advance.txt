* ORM(Object-Relational Mapping)

-- An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique and framework that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
--  In the context of Python, ORMs are used to bridge the gap between the object-oriented world of Python and the relational world of databases. 
-- An ORM abstracts the low-level database operations (e.g., SQL queries) and allows developers to work with databases using Python objects and classes.
Instead of writing SQL queries directly, you define Python classes to represent database tables and use Python methods to interact with the data

----------------------------------------

* Object Oriented Programming in Python:
-- Python is an OOPs Language i.e it supports creation and use of objects and classes.

1. Class Defination:
-- bliueprint for creating objects.

# class defination
class Person:
    def __init__(self,name,city):
        self.name=name
        self.city=city
    def profile(self):
            print(f"{self.name} from {self.city}.")

# create an object
person=Person("Dilip","Nashik") 
person.profile() # Dilip from Nashik.
print(person.name) #Dilip
print(person.city) #Nashik

2. Inheritance:

class Person2(Person):
    def sayHello(self):
        print(f"Hello from {self.name}")

person2=Person2("Ajay","Sinnar")
person2.sayHello() # Hello from Ajay

------------------------------------------------
## Explain the Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction in Python with examples:

1. Encapsulation:
-- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, which is called a class. 
-- It also includes the idea of restricting direct access to some of an ovbects components.
-- Encapsulation is achieved by private and protected attributes.

class Student:
    def __init__(self , name, age):
        self.__name=name # private attribute
        self.age=age
    
    def get_name(self):
        print(self.__name)
    
    def get_age(self):
        print(self.age)

    def set_name(self,name):
        self.__name=name
student= Student("Dilip",25)
# print(student.name)
print(student.age) # 25
student.get_name() # Dilip
student.set_name("Sanap")
student.get_name() # Sanap

2. Polymorphism

class Person:
    def __init__(self,name, city):
        self.name=name
        self.city=city
    
    def profile(self):
        print(f"{self.name} from {self.city}")

person1=Person('Dilip',"Nashik")
person1.profile()

person2=Person("Ajay","Sinnar")
person2.profile()

3. Abstraction:
class Square:
    def __init__(self,side):
        self.__side=side

    def area(self):
        return self.__side**2

a=Square(4)
# print(a.side) 

print(a.area()) #16

--------------------------------------------

* Exception Handling:

-- Python has a wide range of built-in exception that cover various error exception. 
--Some common exception include "TypeError", "ValueError", "ZeroDivisionError", "indexError", and "FileNotFoundError".

* try and except, and optionally 'finally' block

'try': block contain code that might raise an exception
'except': block specifies how to handle exception if one occurs.

try:
    result=10/0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("An error occured",e)

* multiple except blocks

try:
    num=int("abc")
except ValueError as e:
    print("ValueError",e)
except TypeError as e:
    print("TypeError",e)

* finally block:

try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print("File not found:", e)
finally:
    file.close()  # Always close the file, even if there was an exception



* Custom Exception:
class MyCustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise MyCustomError("This is a custom exception")
except MyCustomError as e:
    print("Custom error") #Custom error


-----------------------------------------

* pass in python:

-- pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing.
-- "its used when a statement is syntactically required" but dont want to execute any code.

1. Empty code blocks:

def my_function():
    pass
for i in range(5):
    pass

2. Stubs for unimplemented code:
def future_function():
    pass

3. empty except block:

try:

except ExceptionType:
    pass

-----------------------------------------

* File handling:


1. Read file:

user "open()"

# Openig a file for reading

file=open("example.txt","r")

# Reading data from the file

data=file.read()
print(data)

# Closing the file 
file.close()



# Read line by line

file=open("example.txt","r")

for line in file:
print(line, end="") # end="" to avoid double spacing(newlines)
file.close()

2. Write file:

can write data to a file using modes like "w" (write) or "a" (append). Be careful with the "w" mode as it will overwrite the existing content.

file= open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("This is a sample text.")
file.close()

# Appending to a file
file = open("output.txt", "a")
file.write("\nThis is an appended line.")
file.close()

-------------------------------------------------

* Python Libraries and Modules:

-- Python's power and versatility come from its extensive libraries and modules.

(1) Standard Library:

--"math": Provide mathematical functions 'sqrt', 'sin', 'cos',etc.

--'datetime': date and time manupulation

-- 'os' : Allows interaction with operating system, such as file and directory operations.

--'json': json data

--'collections': alternative to built-in data types like 'namedtuple' and 'deque'

-- 'random': generate random numbers.

(2) Third party libraries:

Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries created by the community to extend its capabilities. Some popular third-party libraries include:

NumPy: For numerical computing and working with arrays.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Requests: For making HTTP requests and working with APIs.
Django and Flask: For web development.
PyTorch and TensorFlow: For deep learning and machine learning.
