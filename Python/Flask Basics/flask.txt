* What is Flask, and how does it differ from other web frameworks?

-- Flask is a "micro web framework" for building web applications in Python. 
-- It is known for its simplicity and minimalism, designed to be lightweight and flexible, allowing developers to build web applications quickly and easily.
1. Micro Framework:
Flask is a simple and minimalistic web framework in Python.
2. Minimalistic Design:

It offers just the basics, leaving many decisions to developers.

3. Extensible:

Flask allows you to add extra features through third-party extensions.

4. No Fixed Structure:

You're free to organize your code as you see fit; Flask doesn't enforce a specific structure.

5. Lightweight:

Flask has few dependencies, making it great for smaller projects.

6. RESTful-Friendly:

Ideal for building RESTful web services and APIs.

7. Jinja2 Templating:

Uses Jinja2 for flexible HTML templating.

8. Built-in Server:

Comes with a built-in development server for easy testing during development.

-----------------------------------------------

* Explain the process of setting up a basic Flask application.

1. python -m venv venv
2. venv\Scripts\activate
3. pip install Flask

4. from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0',debug=True)

5. python app.py

--------------------------------------------

* How does routing work in Flask, and what are its main components?

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'This is the home page.'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'This is the about page.'

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def profile(username):
    return f'Profile page for {username}'

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    return 'Data submitted via POST'

@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(error):
    return "This page does not exist.", 404

from flask import redirect

@app.route('/old')
def old():
    return redirect('/new')


-------------------------------------------------
* What is a Flask blueprint, and why would you use one?

-- Blueprints help break down a large application into smaller, manageable pieces. 
-- Each piece can handle specific features or functionalities, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.

-----------------------------------------------
* How does Flask handle HTTP requests and responses?

----------------------------------------------

* What are Flask extensions, and name some commonly used ones

-- Flask extensions are additional libraries or packages that you can integrate with your Flask application to add extra functionality and features.
-- elp extend Flask's core capabilities to include things "like database integration, authentication, form handling"

1. Flask-SQLAlchemy:

Integrates SQLAlchemy, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to work with databases in Flask applications.

2. Flask-WTF (Flask-Form):

Provides form handling and validation, making it easier to work with HTML forms in Flask applications.

3. Flask-Login:

Handles user session management and user authentication in your application.

5. Flask-RESTful:

Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs in Flask applications, making it easier to define resources, routes, and request parsing.

6. Flask-Mail:

Adds email support to your Flask application, allowing you to send and receive emails.

7. Flask-Session:

Provides session management for Flask applications, allowing you to store user data between requests.

8. Flask-CORS:

Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your application, which is useful when you need to make requests to your API from different domains.

9. Flask-JWT-Extended:

Simplifies the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication in your Flask API.


9. Flask-Principal:

Adds role-based access control to your application, allowing you to control user permissions.

9. Flask-RESTPlus:

An extension for building REST APIs with Flask that includes features like automatic documentation generation using Swagger.

10. Flask-Assets:

Manages asset bundles and helps with asset optimization, such as combining and minifying CSS and JavaScript files.

10. Flask-Caching:

Provides caching functionality for your application to improve performance by storing the results of expensive operations.

11. Flask-Redis:

Allows you to work with Redis, a popular in-memory data store, in Flask applications.

12. Flask-Uploads:

Simplifies file uploads in your application by managing file storage and handling file-related tasks.

13. Flask-SocketIO:

Adds WebSocket support to your application for real-time, bidirectional communication.

14. Flask-OAuthlib:

Enables integration with OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 authentication flows, which are commonly used for third-party API access.

15. Flask-Security:

Provides a high-level security framework for Flask, including features like user authentication, role management, and more.

16. Flask-Admin:

Offers a simple and flexible way to create administrative interfaces for your application's data.

17. Flask-Migrate:

Works in conjunction with Flask-SQLAlchemy to manage database schema migrations, making it easy to update your database schema as your application evolves.
